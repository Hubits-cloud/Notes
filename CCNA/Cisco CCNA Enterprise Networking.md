# üìò CCNA Enterprise Networking Module 1: OSPF

## 1.1 Introduction to OSPF

- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**: Link-state routing protocol, alternative to RIP.
- **OSPFv2**: IPv4 networks | **OSPFv3**: IPv6 networks.
- RIP relies on hop count; OSPF uses cost (bandwidth-based), better for scalability and convergence.
- **Link**: Interface or network segment.
- **Link-State**: Info about link (prefix, length, cost).
- **Focus**: Single-area OSPFv2.

## 1.2 Components of OSPF

### OSPF Packets

1. **Hello** ‚Äì Discover/maintain neighbors.
2. **DBD** ‚Äì Summary of LSDB.
3. **LSR** ‚Äì Request detailed LSA.
4. **LSU** ‚Äì Send full LSA.
5. **LSAck** ‚Äì Acknowledge LSU.

### Data Structures

- **Adjacency DB** ‚Äì Neighbor table.
- **LSDB** ‚Äì Topology table.
- **Forwarding DB** ‚Äì Routing table.

### Algorithm

- **Dijkstra SPF Algorithm** ‚Äì Builds SPF tree, selects shortest path.

## 1.3 Link-State Operation Steps

1. **Establish Neighbor Adjacencies** ‚Äì Send Hello packets.
2. **Exchange LSAs** ‚Äì Share link state and cost.
3. **Build LSDB** ‚Äì Topology table from LSAs.
4. **Run SPF** ‚Äì Create SPF tree.
5. **Select Best Route** ‚Äì Best path to IP routing table.

## 1.4 OSPF Areas

- **Single-Area OSPF**: All routers in one area (usually Area 0).
- **Multi-Area OSPF**: Divides routing domain into multiple areas.
  - **ABR**: Connects backbone (Area 0) to other areas.
  - Benefits: Smaller routing tables, reduced SPF frequency and LSA overhead.

## 1.5 OSPFv3 (for IPv6)

- Equivalent to OSPFv2 for IPv6.
- Supports both IPv4 & IPv6 with Address Families (not in scope).
- Operates using same logic, separate processes for v2/v3.

## 1.6 OSPF Neighbor States

1. **Down** ‚Äì No Hello received.
2. **Init** ‚Äì Received Hello.
3. **Two-Way** ‚Äì Bidirectional Hello seen.
4. **ExStart** ‚Äì Decide who sends DBD first (higher Router ID).
5. **Exchange** ‚Äì Send DBDs.
6. **Loading** ‚Äì Request missing LSAs (LSRs/LSUs).
7. **Full** ‚Äì LSDB synchronized.

## 1.7 DR/BDR

- **Why?** Reduce adjacencies & LSA flooding in multiaccess networks.
- **Adjacency Formula**: `n(n-1)/2`
- **DR/BDR Roles**:
  - **DR**: Central LSA hub.
  - **BDR**: Backup to DR.
  - **DROTHER**: Other routers.

---

# 2.0 Overview

- **Focus**: Single-Area OSPFv2 implementation in point-to-point & multiaccess networks.
- **Benefits**: Fast convergence, route control, manual DR override.

## 2.1 OSPF Basics

### 2.1.1 Router ID

- 32-bit ID used to identify OSPF routers.
- Chosen by:
  1. Manually with `router-id`
  2. Highest loopback IP
  3. Highest active physical IP

### 2.1.2 Configure Router ID

```bash
interface loopback0
 ip address 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.255
router ospf 10
 router-id 1.1.1.1
```

- Use `clear ip ospf process` to apply new ID.

## 2.2 OSPF Interface Configuration

### 2.2.1 Wildcard Masks

- Inverse of subnet mask (e.g., `/24 = 0.0.0.255`)
- Match = 0, Ignore = 1

### 2.2.2 `network` vs `ip ospf`

- `network 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0` (global mode)
- `ip ospf 10 area 0` (interface mode)

### 2.2.3 Passive Interfaces

- Stops OSPF Hello msgs on interfaces not facing other routers.
```bash
router ospf 10
 passive-interface Loopback0
```

## 2.3 OSPF Network Types

### 2.3.1 Point-to-Point

- Avoid DR/BDR election with:
```bash
interface g0/0
 ip ospf network point-to-point
```

### 2.3.2 Multiaccess Networks

- Ethernet = broadcast multiaccess.
- DR/BDR elected to minimize LSA flooding.
- Election rules:
  1. Highest priority (0‚Äì255)
  2. Highest router ID (if tie)
- Configure priority:
```bash
interface g0/0
 ip ospf priority 255
```

## 2.4 Cost and Metrics

### 2.4.1 Cost Formula

```text
Cost = Reference Bandwidth / Interface Bandwidth
Default = 100,000,000 bps
```

### 2.4.2 Modify Cost

- Change reference bandwidth:
```bash
router ospf 10
 auto-cost reference-bandwidth 10000
```

- Manually set cost:
```bash
interface g0/0
 ip ospf cost 30
```

## 2.5 Default Route Propagation

- ASBR (e.g., R2) needs:
```bash
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 loopback1
router ospf 10
 default-information originate
```

## 2.6 OSPF Verification

Commands:
```bash
show ip interface brief
show ip route
show ip ospf neighbor
show ip protocols
show ip ospf
show ip ospf interface
```

# **Module 4: ACL Concepts - Summary**

## üöß **4.0 Introduction**
- ACLs filter traffic like a security guard at a gate.
- Uses Access Control Entries (ACEs) to permit or deny traffic.

---

## üì¶ **4.1 ACL Basics**
- ACL = IOS commands that inspect packet headers to allow or deny traffic.
- Default: No ACLs. Must apply to interface to be active.
- Packet filtering compares packet data to ACEs in order.
- **Types**:
  - Standard: Filters by source IP only (Layer 3).
  - Extended: Filters by source/destination IP, protocol, ports (Layer 3/4).
- ACLs apply to **inbound** (before routing) or **outbound** (after routing) traffic.

---

## üéØ **4.2 Wildcard Masks**
- Used to match bits in IP addresses.
  - `0 = match`, `1 = ignore`
- Example uses:
  - Host: `0.0.0.0`
  - Subnet: `0.0.0.255`
  - Range: `0.0.15.255`
- Shortcut: `Wildcard = 255.255.255.255 - Subnet Mask`
- **Keywords**:
  - `host` = exact match (0.0.0.0)
  - `any` = match all (255.255.255.255)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **4.3 ACL Application & Best Practices**
- Max 4 ACLs per interface (IPv4 in/out + IPv6 in/out).

  ```bash
  ip access-list standard <name>
  {permit|deny} <source> [wildcard]
  ```
- **Apply ACL**:
  ```bash
  interface <int>
  ip access-group <name|number> in|out
  ```

---

## üîß 5.2 Modifying ACLs

- **Method 1: Text Editor**
  - Copy from `show run`, edit, `no access-list`, re-paste.

- **Method 2: Sequence Numbers**
  - Delete specific ACE: `no <seq>`
  - Add new ACE with specific sequence:
    ```bash
    ip access-list standard <name>
    15 deny 192.168.10.5
    ```

- **Check Matches**:
  ```bash
  show access-lists
  clear access-list counters <name>
  ```

---

## üîê 5.3 Securing VTY Lines

- **Steps**:
  1. Create ACL for allowed hosts.
  2. Apply to VTY lines using `access-class`.

- **Example**:
  ```bash
  ip access-list standard ADMIN-HOST
    permit 192.168.10.10
    deny any
  line vty 0 4
    login local
    transport input ssh
    access-class ADMIN-HOST in
  ```

---

## üì¶ 5.4 Extended ACLs

- **Use When**: Need control by protocol, port, source/destination.
- **Syntax**:
  ```bash
  access-list <number> permit tcp <src> <src_wildcard> <dst> <dst_wildcard> eq <port>
  ```
- **Named Extended ACL**:
  ```bash
  ip access-list extended <name>
    permit tcp any any eq www
    permit tcp any any eq 443
  ```

- **Apply**:
  ```bash
  interface <int>
  ip access-group <ACL_name|number> in|out
  ```

- **TCP `established` Keyword**:
  - Allows return traffic only:
    ```bash
    access-list 120 permit tcp any <private_net> established
    ```

---

## üìÑ 5.5 Verification

- **Commands**:
  ```bash
  show ip interface <int> | include access list
  show access-lists

```bash
ip nat inside source static <inside-local> <inside-global>
interface G0/0
 ip nat inside
interface S0/1/0
 ip nat outside
```
- Static NAT is used for servers needing constant access.

---

```bash
ip nat pool POOL_NAME <start-ip> <end-ip> netmask <mask>
access-list 1 permit <source-ip> <wildcard>
ip nat inside source list 1 pool POOL_NAME
```
- Requires access list + NAT pool.

---

```bash
ip nat inside source list 1 interface <outside-int> overload
```
- Uses interface IP and port numbers for translations.
- Most commonly used NAT type in networks.

---

## üß™ 6.6 Verify NAT
```bash
show ip nat translations
show ip nat statistics
```
- Use extended pings for testing:
```bash
ping
<target-ip>
source <inside-local-ip>
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 6.7 Troubleshoot NAT
- Check interface NAT roles: `ip nat inside` / `ip nat outside`
- Verify ACL and NAT pool match intended traffic.
- Check NAT table and stats for expected translations.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary
- NAT provides public access to private IPs.
- Static = fixed 1:1, Dynamic = pool, PAT = many:1.
- Requires correct ACLs, NAT rules, and interface roles.
- Always verify using `show` commands and ping tests.

# **Module 9: Quality of Service (QoS) Concepts**

---

## üö¶ 9.1 Network Congestion & QoS Basics

- **QoS**: Ensures high-priority traffic (voice/video) is delivered reliably.
- **Congestion**: Occurs when traffic exceeds bandwidth; leads to delay, jitter, and packet loss.
- **Delay Types**: Fixed (transmission time) & variable (queuing, processing).
- **Jitter**: Variation in delay between packets; affects real-time traffic.
- **Packet Loss**: Caused by buffer overflow during congestion.

---

## üéØ 9.2 Traffic Characteristics

- **Voice**:
  - Predictable, delay/jitter-sensitive.
  - Needs ‚â§150ms latency, ‚â§30ms jitter, ‚â§1% loss.
  - Uses RTP (ports 16384‚Äì32767), needs ‚â•30 Kbps.

- **Video**:
  - Bursty, high bandwidth, delay/loss-sensitive.
  - Needs ‚â§400ms latency, ‚â§50ms jitter, ‚â§1% loss.
  - Uses RSTP (port 554), needs ‚â•384 Kbps.

- **Data**:
  - Varies in behavior.
  - Less sensitive to delay/loss (uses TCP).
  - Admins consider QoE: interactivity & criticality.

---

## üìö 9.3 Queuing Mechanisms

- **FIFO**: First-in, first-out; no priority.
- **WFQ**: Fair queuing by flow; auto traffic classification.
- **CBWFQ**: User-defined classes with guaranteed bandwidth.
- **LLQ**: Adds priority queue to CBWFQ; ideal for voice.

---

## üß© 9.4 QoS Models

- **Best Effort**:
  - No guarantees, all traffic equal.
  - Simple but no prioritization.

- **Integrated Services (IntServ)**:
  - Guarantees per-flow QoS using RSVP.
  - High overhead; not scalable.

- **Differentiated Services (DiffServ)**:
  - Class-based traffic treatment.
  - Scalable and widely used.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 9.5 QoS Implementation Tools

- **Classification & Marking**:
  - Use ACLs, NBAR, class maps.
  - Mark packets at Layer 2 (CoS - 802.1p) or Layer 3 (DSCP).
  - DSCP categories: BE (0), EF (46), AFxy (class/drop precedence).

- **Trust Boundaries**:
  - Mark traffic close to source (e.g., IP phones).
  - Define what devices to trust for marking.

- **Congestion Avoidance**:
  - **WRED**: Drops lower-priority traffic early to avoid buffer overflow.

- **Shaping vs Policing**:
  - **Shaping**: Buffers excess outbound traffic.
  - **Policing**: Drops or re-marks inbound traffic over limit.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- QoS ensures performance for real-time traffic via classification, prioritization, and shaping.
- Voice/video require tight delay/jitter/loss control.
- Queuing & marking policies dictate treatment under congestion.
- DiffServ is the most scalable QoS model in use today.
